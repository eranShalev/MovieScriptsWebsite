        <pre>
FADE IN ON:

A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

						CUT TO:

THIS KID

lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's
seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,
presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's
hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,
somewhere in the suburbs.

						CUT TO:

The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his
pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's
worried, it doesn't show. During this

		MOTHER
	You feeling any better?

		THE KID
	A little bit.

		MOTHER
	Guess what.

		THE KID
	What?

		MOTHER
	Your grandfather's here.

		THE KID
		(not overjoyed)
	Mom, can't you tell him that I'm
	sick?

		MOTHER
	You are sick, that's why he's here.

		THE KID
	He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

		MOTHER
	Maybe he won't.

							   2.


The Kid shoots her an "I'm sure" look, as we

						CUT TO:

THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of
rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package
tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid,
pinches his cheek.

		GRANDFATHER
	Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother
ignores it, beats a retreat.

		MOTHER
	I think I'll leave you two pals.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

		GRANDFATHER
	I brought you a special present.

		THE KID
	What is it?

		GRANDFATHER
	Open it up.

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

		THE KID
	A book?

		GRANDFATHER
	That's right. When I was your
	age, television was called books.
	And this is a special book. It
	was the book my father used to
	read to me when I was sick, and I
	used to read it to your father.
	And today, I'm gonna read it to
	you.

		THE KID
	Has it got any sports in it?

						CUT TO:

THE GRANDFATHER

Suddenly passionate.
							   3.


		GRANDFATHER
	Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting.
	Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters.
	Chases. Escapes. True love.
	Miracles.

						CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed.

		THE KID
		(manages a shrug)
	It doesn't sound too bad. I'll
	try and stay awake.

		GRANDFATHER
	Oh. Well, thank you very much.
	It's very nice of you. Your vote
	of confidence is overwhelming.
	All right.
		(Book open now, be
		begins to read.)
	The Princess Bride, by S.
	Morgenstern. Chapter One.
	Buttercup was raised on a small
	farm in the country of Florin.

						DISSOLVE TO:

The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of
the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English
countryside.

		GRANDFATHER
		(off-screen)
	Her favorite pastimes were riding
	her horse and tormenting the farm
	boy that worked there. His name
	was Westley, but she never called
	him that.
		(to the kid)
	Isn't that a wonderful beginning?

		THE KID
		(off-screen doing his best)
	Yeah. It's really good.

		GRANDFATHER
		(off-screen reading)
	Nothing gave Buttercup as much
	pleasure as ordering Westley
	around.

Delivery Guy: I got a delivery for ya'.

          Michael: Leave it at reception.
          
          Delivery: I'm supposed to deliver this one in person. [pulls out a gun and starts shooting at Michael, who dodges dramatically]
          
          Michael: [pulls out two handguns and kills the man with an unnecessarily large amount of bullets] Clean up on aisle five. [Threat Level: Midnight titlescreen appears]
          
          Narrator: [Stanley's voice as the screen shows Scarn Manor] Michael Scarn, well that's an interesting story. [headlines of Michael Scarn's success are shown as well as an article reporting the death of Michael's wife, Catherine Zeta Scarn] He was once the best secret agent in the business. That was years ago. Where is he now? Well, that's also an interesting story.
          
          Samuel: [Dwight Schrute dressed as a butler. Speaks in slow, deep voice] Master Scarn.
          
          Samuel: [crashes cymbals by Michael's ear]
          
          Michael: [lying on bed with a bottle of alcohol] I'm up.
          
          Samuel: It's the president. He needs you for a mission.
          
          Michael: Tell him I'm retired.
          
          Dwight: It's Goldenface.
          
          Michael: Goldenface, this makes it personal.
          
          President: [Darryl, sitting at a desk in the Oval Office] Scarn, you're right on time. [cheering from the office]
          
          President: It's your old enemy, Goldenface. He's after the NHL All Star Game. He's hidden a bomb somewhere in the stadium. Scarn, this one is personal for me. I own the stadium. I can't see it blown up. It's my retirement plan.
          
          Samuel: We have to search the stadium.
          
          President: Not so fast, Goldenface has taken all the concession stand workers hostage. Scarn, will you find these hostages, and save the game?
          
          Michael: [holding a quarter up] Heads I do it, tails I don't. Best out of seven. [flips the coin] Heads. [flips it again] Tails. [President winces each time he says tails]...Heads...Tails...Heads...Tails. [flips one more time and the quarter spins around on the table. Michael looks at it] Well, it looks like there's going to be a clean-up on aisle five.
          
          Narrator: Well, the hostages were scared.
          
          Kevin: [as a hostage] Don't you guys get it? Nobody's coming for us.
          
          Goldenface: [Jim, with his face painted with metallic gold paint] Oh someone's coming alright, the only man who would care. [Goldenface turns in his chair, holding a golden gun] Michael Scarn. See I'm gonna lure him here, then I kill everybody, then... I'm gonna dig up Scarn's dead wife, and I'm gonna hump her real good. [malicious, deep laughter]
          
          Narrator: [scene shows Michael Scarn driving through the rain] Well, the All Star Game was three days away, so naturally it was all sold out. The only way Scarn was getting in was in a uniform. Just one problem with that, Scarn didn't know a hockey stick from a Slim Jim. So he went to meet with the famed trainer... [Michael stops the car and gets out] Cherokee Jack.
          
          Cherokee Jack: [Creed wearing a tunic and carrying a mop, standing with Michael in front of an ice rink] Mop the ice.
          
          Michael: I'm not here to learn how to mop, I'm here to learn how to play hockey.
          
          Cherokee Jack: Mop it. [A montage of Michael mopping the ice awkwardly and using an ab-cruncher, and slowly getting better. After a little while, Cherokee Jack Slams a hockey stick on the ice to stop Michael, then offers it to him] Now take this.
          
          Michael: What am I supposed to do with this?
          
          Cherokee Jack: Mop. [a montage shows Michael sliding around the ice skillfully and hitting the puck into the goal]
          
          Narrator: Well, Michael Scarn was quickly becoming one of the hottest hockey players in the country.
          
          Ryan: [Ryan is acting as an official for the competition taking place. A line is formed in front of a line on the ice. Standing behind it are Michael Scarn, Oscar in a blue full-body suit, and a mysterious man in a hockey mask] Each year, the National Hockey League selects one civilian amateur to play in the All Star Game. It's down to the three of you. The final test is speed skating. [holds a gun to the ceiling] On your marks, get set...
          
          Goldenface: Die! [The masked man pulls off the mask to reveal that it is Goldenface]
          
          Michael: [Michael and Goldenface skate around the rink, Goldenface shooting with a solid gold gun, Michael with two pistols. Michael is out of breath at the end of the race] Nice try Goldenface, but you forgot one thing, to kill me.
          
          Goldenface: I wasn't trying to kill you, I was trying to slow you down. [Ryan is seen placing a medal around Oscar's neck]
          
          Michael: No!
          
          Goldenface: Oh by the way!
          
          Michael: Yeah?
          
          Goldenface: How's your wife doing?
          
          Michael: [begins to cry as Goldenface laughs]
          
          Michael: Congratulations.
          
          Oscar: Hey, you came in second. Not bad either.
          
          Michael: I am sorry that I have to do this... [starts choking Oscar to death with his towel]
          
          Oscar: Huh...[muffled screaming as he slowly chokes, and eventually dies]
          
          Michael: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
          
          Samuel: I'm intercepting a name. Jasmine Winsong. She works for Goldenface. What I can't figure out is, who is the Funky Cat.
          
          Michael: Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest Jazz Club in town. [stands up with his cup of tea and walks by Samuel, pouring his tea all over him]
          
          Samuel: Oh-[starts to freak out, but the scene is crudely cut short]
          
          Jan: [acting as a jazz singer at the Funky Cat, singing] They call me Jasmine Winsong.
          
          Michael: [walking into the Funky Cat] Bingo.
          
          Jan: [singing gibberish while laying on the piano on stage]
          
          Michael: [pulls out a recording device from his pocket and clicks it on]
          
          Jan: [michael pushes the backwards button on the recorder] The hostages are under the stadium. [An assassin with a golden tie shoots her with a tranquilizer and she falls]
          
          Michael: Jack Blaise.
          
          Pam: You have to let us go Goldenface! We have families!
          
          Goldenface: Ha! This is gonna show them [cocks his golden gun] that I mean business. See ya! [points gun to Toby the hostage's head, shoots and Toby's fake head explodes, the shot is shown repeatedly]
          
          Samuel: Ha! [kicking open the gate in the stadium where the hostages and Goldenface are]
          
          Kevin: Michael Scarn!
          
          Goldenface: Sorry about your friend, Scarn!
          
          Michael: The joke's on you Goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist.
          
          Goldenface: [gives Michael a disgusted look]
          
          Samuel: We've searched the whole building, Goldenface, where is the bomb?
          
          Goldenface: Hm?
          
          Samuel: We've searched the whole building, Goldenface, where is the bomb?

          Michael: Why are you telling me this?
          
          Goldenface: Because I'm going to kill you. [takes out golden gun] Unless! You forgive me for murdering your wife. [distraught, memories of him and his wife are shown on the puck in a dreamy haze]
          
          Michael: Hey Goldenface.
          
          Goldenface: Yeah?
          
          Michael: Go puck yourself!
          
          Goldenface: [dodges the puck and shoots at Michael]
          
          Samuel: Noooo! [jumps in front of Michael to receive the bullet]
          
          Goldenface: [re-cocks gun and shoots at Michael, who looks shocked and scared]
          
          Michael: More Tylenol.
          
          Helene: [as a busty nurse] You've already had four.
          
          Pam: Looking at her mother on screen, horrified] Oh God... [looks at Michael] So good.
          
          Helene: You're lucky to be alive.
          
          Michael: It'll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn.
          
          Helene: Let's just make sure that everything's... Working properly... [leans in closer to Michael and the heart rate monitor, which was beating steadily, now beats very quickly]
          
          President: You just said the bomb... is in the puck?
          
          Michael and Samuel together: Yes.
          
          President: Is that where you hid the bomb Goldenface?
          
          Goldenface: [walks into the Oval Office with an accomplice, Troy]
          
          Samuel: But why would you blow up the stadium? You OWN the stadium!
          
          Michael: For the insurance money! I knew it all along! [the President, Goldenface, and his minion pull out automatic machine guns] You will never get away with this! [takes a painting of Abraham Lincoln and awkwardly smashes it on the President's head, runs out of the office as Goldenface and his minion shoot at them]
          
          Michael: Where had I gone wrong? All I wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife. But somewhere along the way, things got messed up.
          
          Narrator: It wasn't easy for Scarn to admit that he had lost his self-confidence. And he hadn't of course, He just wasn't using it right now.
          
          Michael: [in a bar] Beer me Billy.
          
          Billy: [Andy as a bar tender with a Brooklyn accent] You don't looks so good, what's got ya down?
          
          Michael: I got problems Billy. Big problems...
          
          Billy: You got problems?! My TV don't work! I pay thirty bucks a month for the damn satellite what's-a-whosit, I can't even get the damn game! Now you tell me, what's worse than that?
          
          Michael: [laughs to himself] Don't ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow.
          
          Billy: I see what you mean about problems. I know what'll cheer you up. That table of bachelorettes over there bought you this drink. [a table with Meredith, Phyllis, Karen, and Angela all say hey to Michael]
          
          Karen: Ever banged an entire bachelorette party, baby? [winks]
          
          Michael: I'm too depressed to save the big game Billy.
          
          Billy: I'm gonna cheer you up, the only ways I know hows. [to a small boy in overalls] Hey kid! Hit G-9 on the Jukebox!
          
          Michael: No Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died.
          
          Billy: There is a whole crowd of people out there, who need to learn, how to do The Scarn.
          
          Michael: [A funky beat sounds from the Jukebox and Michael starts dancing poorly] Well my name's Michael Scarn and I'm here to say, I'm about to do The Scarn in a major way. [the bachelorettes and the others in the bar stand up to join him] You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! [doing the actions he says to] You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn!
          
          Todd Packer: [as a drunken man in the bar] If doing The Scarn is gay, then I'm the biggest queer on Earth!
          
          Samuel: Michael! You have to get to that puck before halftime! Or the whole stadium will explode!
          
          Michael: I know, it's a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on!
          
          Samuel: Cherokee Jack? Michael he died.
          
          Michael: [crying] This one's for you Cherokee Jack. [Michael skates into the rink of an already in-play match]
          
          Pam: Why is your face gold?
          
          Goldenface: Why do you care?
          
          Pam: I'm just making conversation.
          
          Goldenface: I worked in a gold factory, we had a boss, who only cared about money...
          
          Hostage: Please Goldenface, let us go!
          
          Michael: [ees Cherokee Jack from a confusion of heavenly light and smoke] Cherokee Jack.
          
          Cherokee Jack: I want you to take all of your frustrations, with women, the system, with everything. Take it out on the puck. All on the puck.
          
          Michael: [skates forward, hits the puck, and stares in wonder as it flies by]
          
          Samuel: Yah! [kicks open the gate to save the hostages, hostages rejoice as Samuel unties them] [the puck is seen flying into space and it hits a satellite, Billy is at his bar and his TV suddenly turns back on]
          
          Billy: Hey! We got sports games again! [people at the bar cheer]
          
          Goldenface: [seen at his house counting his money] Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! [The puck lands on his lap] Oh-[A large explosion blocks out his words] [The office cheers at the ending of the movie, Michael Scarn holds up a trophy]
          
          Michael: [in Scarn manor] Some breakfast for me [shows a plate of bacon and eggs] and some breakfast for you. [pulls out an oil can and oils Samuel's circuit board on his back]
          
          Michael: [phone rings] I'll get it! Man I love being retired! Scarn here!
          
          President: [on phone] Michael, it's the president.
          
          Michael: Hello sir.
          
          President: I need you for another mission.
          
          Michael: Ugh... [after a little thought] I'm in.
          
          Andy: [the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
          
          Michael: Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is!
          
          Dwight: No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
          
          Michael: No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. [the office laughs]
          
          Narrator: [in Stanley's voice, a chair is shown with a gray haired head sticking above it] Well, Michael Scarn was back in the game. And I bet you're wondering why do I know so much about Michael Scarn. [the chair revolves to show Michael Scarn, gray haired, talking with Stanley's voice] Well because I AM Michael Scarn. [applause]
          
          Rapper: [Andy rapping to a montage of scenes from the movie] Ahhhh, yeah! Threat Level Midnight! Makes all the girlies feel alright! From Madonna to Madelyn Allbrite, Threat Level Midnight! It's a threat, a level, a level level threat. He's the greatest hockey-star I ever seen yet. Threat Level what? Midnight! Threat Level who? Michael Scarn! Threat Level why? Apartheid! Gotta fight it, Free Mandela! Peace I'm out!
